# HolographicDisplays

This is a maintained version of HolographicDisplays with several bug fixes. 

## Why a fork?

The previous version was not being maintained and had too many bugs. I needed to use the plugin myself, so here we are! 

## Help, I have an issue!

First try reading the previous wiki: https://github.com/filoghost/HolographicDisplays/wiki

I am still familiarising myself with the codebase so I'm probably not a lot of help right now. But try opening an issue. 

## How do I compile this?

Since HolographicDiplays needs to use nms you must first put all the craftbukkit jars into `libs/spigot`. See the [README.md](https://github.com/redstone/HolographicDisplays/blob/master/libs/README.md) file for more information.

Then simple use gradle:

```bash
gradle build
```

The jar will be compiled and available in `build/libs`. 

Easy right? Enjoy.
